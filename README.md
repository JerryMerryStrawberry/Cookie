<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Q: Why is there a .zip inside the .zip?</p>
<p>A: I had all the files for the game saved to my computer, but was too lazy to upload every single file, so I just zipped it and uploaded that instead. (lol)</p>
<p>Q: What version is this compared to the current Cookie Cliker version?</p>
<p>A: The current version of Cookie Clicker (as of 4-8-23) is 2.051, and this is version is 2.048. There were only some minor bug updates between the updates.</p>
